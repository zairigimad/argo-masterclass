Argo CD Application Project (AppProject) is a logical grouping mechanism that defines boundaries and access controls for applications within Argo CD. It enables administrators to enforce policies on which Git repositories, Kubernetes namespaces, and Kubernetes Objects applications can manage. 

In this Master Class weâ€™ll be going over: 

* How to best manage the `default` Project 
* Creating and Managing Projects
* Multi-tenancy with Projects using RBAC
* How to Configure Global Projects
* Scoping Clusters and Repositories to specific Projects
